# bikesharing
This Java MapReduce project aims at describing bike-sharing systems using keys perfomance metrics computed from data logs (possibly zipped). It also generalizes to other object-sharing systems such as taxi cabs or house-rental (e.g. AirBnB). This software comes with absolutely *NO WARRANTY* whatsoever.

An interesting [research paper](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1201.1178) about bike-sharing networks.
