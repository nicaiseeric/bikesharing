# bikesharing
This Java MapReduce project aims at describing bike-sharing systems using keys perfomance metrics computed from data logs (possibly zipped). It also generalizes to other object-sharing systems such as , taxi cabs or house-rental (e.g. AirBnB).

An interesting research paper about object-sharing systems and in particular bike-sharing is http://arxiv.org/pdf/1201.1178
