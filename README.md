# bikesharing
This Java MapReduce project aims at describing bike-sharing systems using keys perfomance metrics computed from data logs (possibly zipped). It also generalizes to other object-sharing systems such as taxi cabs or house-rental (e.g. AirBnB).

Example of analysis performed this project can be found here : https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8efPSjXXAtNYXJWcW93UXUwcVE


An interesting research paper about bike-sharing networks is http://arxiv.org/pdf/1201.1178
